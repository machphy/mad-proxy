## 🚨 Security Advisory

> **CVE-2025-61767 — HTTPS Traffic Interception Bypass vulnerability fixed in v0.4**  
> - [CVE Record](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-61767)  
> - [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rjrf-hf7c-4vfr)

**Upgrade to v0.4+ immediately to remain protected. See full details in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).**


## Features

- **Intercepts all HTTP and HTTPS browser traffic** via a local proxy server.
- **Customizable policy engine:** Block or allow requests using rules defined in a YAML file (`config.yaml`).
- **Quick integration** with major browsers like Firefox, Chrome, and Brave.
- **Real-time logging** of blocked and allowed requests in the terminal.
- **Supports trusted HTTPS interception** via mitmproxy root certificate installation.
- **Extensible design** for future feature additions and research.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher (3.12+ recommended)
- pip
- mitmproxy
- Linux (tested on Ubuntu/Debian)

### Installation

**Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/machphy/mad-proxy.git
cd mad-proxy
```

**Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Install dependencies:**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration

Edit `mad_proxy/config.yaml` to define your block or allow list:

```
block_domains:
  - "example.com"
  - "unauthorized.site"
```

Add or modify domains as desired.

---

## Browser Setup

1. Set your browser HTTP/HTTPS proxy to `localhost:8080`.  
2. Trust the mitmproxy root certificate:  
   - Run the proxy server (next section).  
   - Visit [http://mitm.it](http://mitm.it) in the browser.  
   - Download and install the certificate following the instructions.

---

## Running the Proxy Server

Start the proxy:

```
python3 proxy_server.py
```

Default is port 8080; modify if needed.

---

## Usage Examples

**Allowed Request:**  
Visiting allowed sites (e.g., https://www.google.com) logs:  

```
Allowed request: https://www.google.com
```

**Blocked Request:**  
Blocked sites (e.g., http://example.com) log:  

```
Blocked request to http://example.com
```

Browser shows a "Blocked by security policy" HTTP 403 message.

## Package Build & Setup Instructions

You can build and install mad-proxy as a Python package.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Install build and twine tools:

```
pip install --upgrade build twine
```

### Step 2: Build the package

Run in project root:

```
python3 -m build
```

This generates `.whl` and `.tar.gz` files in the `dist/` folder.

### Step 3: Local package install

Install the built wheel locally:

```
pip install dist/mad_proxy-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
```

Replace `<version>` with the actual version number.

### Step 4: (Optional) Publish package to PyPI

After configuring `.pypirc` with your PyPI token, run:

```
twine upload dist/*
```

## How to Extend

- Add regex or heuristic-based URL/malicious content detection in `policy_engine.py`.
- Implement advanced logging and alert mechanisms in `utils.py`.
- Build UI for easier rule management.
- Integrate with threat intelligence feeds for automated updates.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Mitmproxy certificate errors:** Ensure the mitmproxy root certificate is installed correctly.
- **Port conflicts:** If port 8080 is busy, change the port in the proxy start command or config.
- **Configuration errors:** YAML formatting is strict—validate `config.yaml` carefully.
